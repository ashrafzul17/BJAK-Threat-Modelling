# Attack 1 Summary: Account Takeover via Credential Stuffing Attacks

## Stages of the Attack
## Origins
The attack begins as an opportunistic attempt to exploit BJAK's user accounts by leveraging widespread credentials leaked from unrelated data breaches. The large user base of BJAK makes it a lucrative target for financial fraud and data exfiltration.

## Reconnaissance
The attacker gathers email-password combinations from public credential dumps or the dark web. Automated tools are utilized to map leaked credentials to BJAK user accounts.

## Weaponization
Specialized credential stuffing tools, such as Hydra or Sentry MBA, are configured to automate login attempts across BJAK's authentication endpoints. Scripts are fine-tuned to evade rate-limiting measures and CAPTCHAs.

## Delivery
The attacker initiates large-scale automated login attempts using the harvested credentials. The attack leverages BJAK's public-facing login interface, targeting weak and reused passwords among users.

## Exploitation
Successful logins lead to unauthorized access to compromised user accounts. Sensitive user data, including personal details, insurance preferences, and linked payment information, is exposed to the attacker.

## Installation
Post-compromise, the attacker alters account details to lock out legitimate users. They may set up fraudulent payment methods or divert user transactions for financial gain.

## Actions on Objectives
With control over compromised accounts, the attacker performs unauthorized actions such as viewing sensitive user data, initiating transactions, or deploying malicious redirects. The stolen information is monetized through dark web sales or direct fraud activities.
