**Controls Required:**

- **Credential Brute Force Protection:** Implement account lockout mechanisms or CAPTCHA to prevent automated login attempts after a specified number of failed attempts.
  
- **Credential Stuffing Detection:** Utilize machine learning algorithms or anomaly detection to identify and block traffic from suspicious IP addresses and high-frequency login attempts.

- **Password Complexity Enforcement:** Enforce strong password policies to require the use of complex passwords, making credential stuffing less effective.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Mandate the use of MFA for account access, preventing unauthorized access even with stolen credentials.

- **Rate Limiting:** Apply rate limits to login attempts to reduce the effectiveness of automated credential stuffing attacks.

- **IP Reputation and Geo-Blocking:** Implement an IP reputation system or geo-blocking to detect and block access from unusual locations or blacklisted IPs.

- **Logging and Monitoring:** Continuously monitor and log user authentication activity to detect and respond to any unusual or suspicious behavior associated with credential stuffing attacks.
  
- **Account Recovery Controls:** Implement secure account recovery processes, including the verification of user identity via secondary channels (e.g., email, phone), to prevent attackers from hijacking accounts after compromising credentials.

- **Education and Awareness:** Educate users on the importance of using unique passwords and preventing the reuse of passwords across multiple platforms.
