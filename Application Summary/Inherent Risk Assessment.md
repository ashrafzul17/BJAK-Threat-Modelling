# Inherent Risk Assessment

```markdown
The BJAK platform processes sensitive data, interacts with third-party APIs, and supports a high volume of users, which presents several inherent risks. Below is the risk assessment for critical components.

## Key Risks

### 1. **Account Takeover (High)**
- **Description**: Unauthorized access due to credential stuffing or password reuse.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce MFA, implement account lockout policies, and monitor suspicious login behavior.

### 2. **API Abuse (High)**
- **Description**: Exploitation of APIs to retrieve unauthorized data or manipulate quotes.
- **Mitigation**: Implement API rate limiting, access control, and input validation.

### 3. **Data Leakage (Medium)**
- **Description**: Exposure of sensitive data through insufficient encryption or misconfigured APIs.
- **Mitigation**: Use end-to-end encryption and regularly audit API configurations.

### 4. **Business Logic Abuse (Medium)**
- **Description**: Manipulation of workflows to gain unfair advantages or bypass validations.
- **Mitigation**: Enforce strict input validation and logic integrity checks.

### 5. **Third-Party Risk (High)**
- **Description**: Compromise of data or functionality via vulnerabilities in insurance providers' APIs.
- **Mitigation**: Conduct third-party risk assessments and enforce contractual security requirements.

## Risk Rating Summary

| Risk Category          | Rating    | Rationale                                     |
|------------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Account Takeover       | High      | Direct impact on user data and trust.         |
| API Abuse              | High      | Could disrupt operations and leak sensitive data. |
| Data Leakage           | Medium    | Significant but controllable with encryption. |
| Business Logic Abuse   | Medium    | Exploitation of specific workflows poses localized risks. |
| Third-Party Risk       | High      | Dependency on third-party APIs increases vulnerability. |
